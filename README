## General info
This browser-based prime/lucky number generator displays all prime/lucky numbers with up to 5 digits and highlights the intersection of the sets. It can be used for checking, for example, zip codes and street address numbers from places one has lived. The animation is achieved via DOM manipulation. The algorithm and animation are based on the sieve of Erastothenes. The code and comments are designed for instructional/learning purposes.
